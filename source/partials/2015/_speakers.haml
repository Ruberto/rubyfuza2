            %p Brendon McLean studied engineering because his career guidance councillor told him there were no jobs in software. He's been writing software ever since. He narrowly escaped a verbose career in enterprise Java when he was offered the role of heading up development at Intellection, a start-up in market research analytics. He jumped at the opportunity and helped build their data analytics platform for market research in Ruby.
            %h3 Extending Ruby by harnessing other languages
            %p What do you do when your Ruby startup takes off and you realise that Ruby might not be best suited for everything? This talk covers our initial attempts to use Ruby as a data analytics platform, and how we ultimately ended up solving the problem using ideas from LISP and ActiveRecord scopes to bring the power and performance of data science languages to Ruby. We will also cover how Ruby can learn from other languages, and why Ruby is still our language of choice.

            %p Rails is a rich framework for developing web applications; following the Ruby mantra of "developer happiness"; it provides an elegant approach to structuring code and functionality to achieve this.
            %p However, there are times when Rails isn't enough, particularly when applications are complex, have lots of functional requirements and a large code base. The talk discusses approaches for extending Rails for continued developer happiness in tackling more complex problems

            %p As Developers we often have certain perceptions of our heroes in developer communities and some of these shape what we think we should aspire for ourselves and why we are presently capable or incapable of different things (contributing to your favorite language or framework e.t.c.). In doing so we become constantly trolled by Tech's invisible monsters though there exists an infinite learning continuum. This talk gives the audience a chance to learn how to become philomath Developers and why its a less draining path to eternal gratification and happiness as Developers.

            %p There has been a global drive in recent years to teach programming to kids in schools. This is a huge opportunity for kids, and more so for South African kids. South Africa is a unique country with unique challenges. Most South African schools lack basic needs such as running water. Computers are perceived as a 'luxury item' and, as a result, kids in these communities have never seen, let alone use a computer before. How do we ensure that these kids still get to learn to code ( the right way) despite all these proudly South African challenges?

As a Tender Tights member, Aaron learned to perfect the technique of self-defense pirouettes so that nobody, not even the Parkour Posse could catch him. Between vicious street dance-offs, Aaron taught himself to program. He learned to combine the art of street ballet with the craft of software engineering. Using these unique skills, he was able to leave his life on the streets and become a professional software engineer. He is currently Pirouetting through Processes, and Couruing through code for AT&T. Sometimes he thinks back fondly on his life in the Tender Tights, but then he remembers that it is better to have Tender Loved and Lost than to never have Tender Taught at all.

            %p Hi There I'm Simon. I'm an aspiring code artisan at Platform45.
            %p I'm a fan of beautiful interfaces, usable and intuitive software. Software has such great potential to change the way that people live. Recently my love for AI and it's potential to solve some of the world's biggest problems is very quickly becoming my life long goal, to add value to peoples lives with the power of technology and software.
            %h3 Diagnosing cancer with Machine Learning
            %p Computational intelligence is the art of building artificial intelligence with software. We’ve all reached for metaphors and stories to explain and model difficult concepts in OOP. Join me on a journey through some of the metaphors used to achieve intelligent behaviour. We will explore the inner workings of a neural network and a training algorithm, and show how to build a classifier to predict a cancer diagnosis with high accuracy. Lastly we'll discuss a non-deterministic way of thinking about software, and what the impact could be for what we believe are intelligent machines.

            %p Have you ever tried to solve a problem, felt like there was a better way, but could never find one? Maybe you are suffering from programming language blindness!
            %p In this session I’m going to take you on my journey through a series of programming languages that made have made me who I am. By the end you will be inspired to start or continue your journey into becoming a polyglot programmer.

            %p I began my career building single page web applications 7 years ago, after being hired by Internet Solutions as a graduate. Since then I have become experienced in many languages and frameworks, from PHP & Perl to Python with Django, Ruby on Rails and Javascript with Backbone & Marionette. My speciality however is frontend development using javascript to create rich user experiences. Frontend architecture is my main focus, applying the principles of modular design in order to scale web apps.
            %h3 I drank the Single Page App kool-aid
            %p I have an embarrassing secret to admit. After 7 years of vocally advocating the heavy use of javascript frameworks to build web applications, I’m starting to have second thoughts.
            %p You would think that the recent explosion in popularity of MVC JS frameworks would have given me a sense of satisfaction. Instead, I’ve never been more concerned that the splintered landscape of frontend development has blinded us to the benefits of the tried and tested solutions that multi-page application development has provided to solve common problems.
            %p There is more, can't fit...

Director of ORT SA CAPE since 2011, her experience and insight helped to develop innovative strategies for improving the quality of education in the Western Cape and is currently using CASPER Robotics and Reading to push this forward. Previously Dr Abel as Director of The Schools Development Unit at UCT for 8 years, she introduced large scale systemic testing. In 2000 she was the Leader of the Foundation Phase Task Team that revised the National Curriculum. Her dynamic leadership has led the ORT SA CAPE team to increase their beneficiaries from 5000 in 2013 to 10 000 in 2014 while aiming for many more in 2015.
            %h3 Rebranding the 3R’s: reading, reasoning and robotics
            %p In order to improve the face of education in South Africa, it is critical and essential to rebrand the 3 R’s  - reading, reasoning and robotics. ORT SA CAPE offers the solution through Robotics -  a pathway to Mathematical concepts, Technical design processes and scientific thinking.  Teamwork, hand-eye-mind coordination and the joy of completing a task successfully are cornerstones of Robotics, which provides a playful bridge integrating academic content with personally meaningful projects. Within our schools, there is an increasing need to improve Science and Technology from Grade R. Conferences have been held urging the introduction of more PLAY, but PLAY without PURPOSE is useless.  Given our unequal society, it is essential to honour the developmental need for play while creating opportunities for young children to learn.

            %h3 Mentoring and being mentored - tips and tricks
            %p We are all in the position of either learning from someone or teaching someone. I've seen too many situations where people could have had an amazing experience but because of an incorrect mindset, they either closed off their minds or quit their job.
            %p I've been on both sides of that fence and thanks to mentors who wouldn't give up on me, I have now seen how incredible a personal mentor can be. I have now been playing the mentor role to numerous developers and have seen first hand how peoples perceptions can be changed by implementing different mindsets.
