            %h2 Designing and building a distributed application using AWS services
            %p Amazon Web Services is pleased to present a workshop in Cape Town the weekend before the Rubyfuza conference. The hack-day will provide hands-on experience designing and building a fun distributed application using AWS services.
            %p The workshop is aimed at seasoned developers. Prior experience using AWS and our SDKs will be to your advantage; however they are well documented and easy to learn in the time you have available.
            %p We'll be building a procedural music generator. You'll build up a library of sound samples by interacting with a variety of AWS services, learning AWS best practices along the way, and combine those samples into a piece of music.
            %p Engineers from AWS will be on hand to help you design and build your system. They'll be doing the judging and will award some great prizes for the best piece of music, and the most creative applications.
            %p We will credit your AWS account with enough money to build your application, as well as play with AWS services after the workshop.
            %h4 Prerequisites:
            %ul.list
              %li Your own AWS account - this requires a credit-card, and it will not be possible to sign up for an account on the day. Please don't use one from your employer!
              %li A laptop with a development environment for your favourite language already configured
            %p
              It's important that you sign up for an AWS account before the event - please drop us an email at
              %a{href: 'mailto:aws-rubyfuza@amazon.com'} aws-rubyfuza@amazon.com
              with your 12-digit AWS account ID so we can credit your account.

            %h2 An Introduction to Functional Programming for Ruby Developers
            %p There is a lot of buzz and hype around functional programming at the moment.  Many claiming it is the only way to scale and write safe code in our multi-core world.  Some of it is true and some of it is hype.  What I've learnt is that functional programming makes us better object oriented developers.  On more than one occasion, FP has offered us a cleaner, sweeter solutions to non-trivial problems.  In this workshop, we will give a hands-on introduction to the main themes of FP, cutting through the hype, favouring practice over theory.  We will play with a few languages like Clojure, Scala, JavaScript (yes!) and maybe Haskell or F# too.  So bring your laptop along and join in.

              Aslam Khan is a software developer for more years than South Africa is a democracy.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code as an expression of design. And the same goes for architecture too - it's all design.  The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very hard.  As developers we need thinking tools, and different paradigms gives us that diversity, hence his interest in functional programming.  He is currently writing a book on functional programming for Manning.  If that doesn't bore you, then try his blog at

              Ryan Lemmer is a Cape Town based software developer. He believes that achieving the "soft" in software is the hardest part, that is, to make code that is pliable enough to withstand relentless change. Functional Programming offers some powerful tools, techniques and perspectives, towards achieving "soft" code. Ryan loves learning and facilitating learning in others.

            %h2 A Scrum Simulation for Newbies and Experienced Agilists
            %p Most software companies are trying some form of an agile process these days, but often people follow the mechanics without understanding the reasons behind why certain things are done.
            %p Join us for a Scrum simulation using LEGO. We will build a product that needs to ship at the end of 2 sprints. We’ll go through each of the Scrum meetings: Backlog Grooming, Sprint Planning parts 1 & 2, Sprint Review and Sprint Retro. First we’ll explain the purpose of the meeting so you understand the reason for doing it, then you’ll get to do it, re-enforcing the learning.
            %p Even if you’ve been doing Scrum for some time, this will be a great refresher of the basics and an opportunity to ask questions about some of the subtleties of Scrum.

            %p Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design.
            %p By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement.
            %p Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.
            %p And it's great fun at the same time!
