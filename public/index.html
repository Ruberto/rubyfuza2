            </div>
            <div class='inner'>
              <p>Sarah Mei has been doing software since before the internet had cats. She’s currently the Chief Consultant of DevMynd, where she helps teams refactor their way out of interesting messes. She also teaches object-oriented design with Sandi Metz, is a director of Ruby Central, and co-founded RailsBridge back in the day. Sarah lives in San Francisco, which is way colder than the California you imagine.</p>
              <h3>Factory, Workshop, Stage</h3>
              <p>Once upon a time, writing software felt a lot like working in a factory. A product went through an assembly-line-like series of stages where each team added their contribution. At the end of the line, the finished product was packaged up and physically shipped to a customer.</p>
              <p>Fast forward sixty years. Both the software itself and our process for making it are radically different from this original conception. But in the absence of a newer, more appropriate model for software development, we've unconsciously retained many industrial-era concepts -- and they're holding us back. We need a new model for software development that captures what we do today, and prepares us to build what we need for tomorrow.</p>
              <p>I will outline a new model for software development that places the people who do it in the center of the picture, instead of on the periphery. Applying it to our projects gives us real, immediate answers to the hardest questions of software today.</p>

              <p>I have been working as a software developer for about 11 years now. I enjoy learning new things and most of all writing software. I consider myself to be a bit of a polyglot developer. Lately I have been enjoying coding in Ruby, Scala, Rust and JavaScript.</p>
              <h3>Reactive Programming Principles</h3>
              <p>Writing distributed applications is tricky enough without throwing concurrency into the mix. As the applications you and I build every day get more and more complex, we need tools and principles that can help us get the job done without sacrificing our sanity. That’s where Reactive Programming comes in. Join me at RubyFuZA where I’ll take you through my journey on learning Reactive Programming Principles and share some of my key learnings with you.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='inner'>
              <p>Rory is a software developer, an aspiring (and perspiring) entrepreneur and a perpetual student. He has developed several methodologies for apologising for the software he has inflicted on others and his spare time is spent honing a speaker bio that is so perfect that he never has to write one of these damn things again. To date he has failed. Although he does feel that he has managed to level up in the key areas of run-on sentences and pointless distracting tangents.</p>
              <h3>What defines quality software?</h3>
              <p>For years, I've believed that there was a univeersal constant that defined quality software and, once the secret ingredient for quality software has been identified, it can be distilled, bottled and sprinkled like fairydust over code - ensuring success.</p>
              <p>This talk will try to determine if there is a single overarching definition of quality software or if, like so many other of life's realities, it is a tad more complicated.</p>

              <p>It's the thing everyone talks about, but no one tends to give full disclosure. This talk covers one of the approaches to figuring out an hourly rate for your time and pitching it to clients.</p>
              <p>It will also cover:</p>
              <p>* the zero value of asking peers for their rates</p>
              <p>* when and how to substantiate a rate</p>

              <h3>Eigenclasses and other Meta-programming Concepts</h3>
              <p>Eigenclasses are an important construct in Ruby and, although obscured from the everyday developer, are core to many meta-programming principles and techniques. We delve into what an eigenclass is, how to access it, and how to make use of this knowledge in order to improve our meta-programming techniques. Method lookup, singleton methods, class_eval and instance_eval, and include and extend will all be explained in the context of eigenclasses. Other useful meta-programming ideas such as scope gates will also be investigated.</p>

              <p>Brendon McLean studied engineering because his career guidance councillor told him there were no jobs in software. He's been writing software ever since. He narrowly escaped a verbose career in enterprise Java when he was offered the role of heading up development at Intellection, a start-up in market research analytics. He jumped at the opportunity and helped build their data analytics platform for market research in Ruby.</p>
              <h3>Literate Programming in Ruby</h3>
              <p>Find out the about the history of literate programming and how it has evolved since Donald Knuth coined the term and implemented it in 1981. You will see several running examples of it in other languages leading up to running implementations in Ruby. Finally, the talk explores what's possible in Rails when you combine markup and code using a Jupyter Kernel for Rails.</p>

              <p>The “kiddibot” fits into the Robotics section. Shaheer and I, are students from CPUT (Cape Peninsula University of Technology). One of the requirements from university in other to complete your degree, is to have a 6 months internship at any company where a project must be completed during that time. We have been received at ORT SA CAPE for our internship. They realized that, walking or robotics workshop were done by children from 6 years old, however some of the kids who were 4 years old wanted to do that as well. Therefore, ORT SA CAPE gave us the responsibility to make a robot for those youngest kids so that they can program and make it work as well. The project was done in 5 months and has been tested with some kids already and was very successful. However, few modifications in terms of design need to be done for a mass production.</p>

His favourite pastimes are graphics programming and monkey-patching the NilClass. He has spoken about Game Development and other topics at Jozi.rb and Pretoria.rb. His game development experience started when he wrote tic-tac-toe for DOS in Turbo Pascal at the age of 11. Since then he has had a keen interest in game development and graphics programming.</p>
              <h3>RubyGL</h3>
              <p>OpenGL is powerful cross-platform library for 3D graphics. It has been used to develop stunning visuals for indie, open-source and AAA games alike, as well as powerful graphics applications for medicine, military, and CAD, to name a few. However, as a C-Library, OpenGL is notoriously difficult to work with, especially for newcomers. Ruby gives us the opportunity to make writing OpenGL applications a more pleasant experience. This talk deals with OpenGL, Ruby, and making the two work together in a way accessible to all developers.</p>

              <h3>Beating Poker With The Help Of Ruby</h3>
              <p>The thing that makes poker such an interesting game is the combination of super deep strategy and the mathematics behind the deck of cards, both of which make decision making around the table extremely difficult. Lucky for us, Ruby can help us with that!</p>
              <p>This talk explores how we can use Ruby to become better poker players by implying various gems and statistical analysis methods both in real time and retrospectively to deepen our understanding of situations and our opponents' strategy and tendencies and ultimately, make better decisions.</p>

Elixir opens up the mysterious world of Erlang to the average developer via an accessible syntax. Let us explore what this wonderful language and platform have to offer by looking at how they apply to building real time features into a typical request-response web application. As a bonus we will also look at how Elixir is particularly suited for complex event processing systems - sounds like all the systems we build, doesn’t it?</p>

              <p>I am a feminist, a committed tea drinker and a budding yogi with the goal of getting into the lotus position without tearing my soul. I like to write code almost as much as I like to sleep. I was born in Johannesburg, raised in Benoni and grew up to become an engineer. I helped build a couple of power stations and then switched to software development. It was worth it.</p>
              <h3>Teaching Kids to Programme with Gosu and Sonic Pi</h3>
              <p>People learn at a young age about what was possible and what was not. Sometimes they develop biases that are not entirely valid. Often they believe that becoming a developer is not a realistic goal or don't even consider it an option.</p>
              <p>Using libraries like Gosu and Sonic Pi that turn metaphors into audio and visual experiences, we can captivate and encourage young people. We can help them learn that code isn't a mythical dragon impossible to slay, but magic they can use that lets them see the true beauty of software development.</p>

              <p>Hi, I’m Ridhwana. I am the co-founder of a bespoke software development company, Zero One. My passion is software development, and nothing brings me more joy than creating a piece of software that will help improve peoples lives. I love exploring new technologies and have recently set my goal to design beautiful interfaces, that boast good user experience.</p>
              <h3>Building a better programming interface for your application</h3>
              <p>We are moving towards an era where API’s are now forming the crux of communication between different applications.</p>
              <p>Hence, we need to ensure that our API's follow a good design and architecture, so that integration between different applications can be accomplished with minimal complexity and maximum efficiency.</p>
              <p>In this talk, I would like to explore the JSON API spec, benefits and disadvantages of micro services, Rails 5 for your JSON API's, and the tools and workflow that, we as developers, can use to minimise delays when working in big teams, asynchronously, on the frontend and API.</p>

              <h3>Stupid Ideas For Many Computers</h3>
              <p>There are plenty of useful things you can do with Ruby and a bunch of servers. This talk isn't about useful things. This talk will show off asinine, amusing, and useless things you can do with Ruby and access to cloud computing.</p>
              <p>Sentiment analysis based on emoji? Why not? Hacky performance testing frameworks? Definitely! Multiplayer infinite battleship? Maybe? The world's most inefficient logic puzzle solver? Awesome!</p>
              <p>If you are interested in having some fun and laughing at reasonable code for unreasonable problems (or unreasonable code for reasonable problems) this talk is for you.</p>

              <h3>Developer Design Thinking</h3>
              <p>Design thinking is a methodology used by designers to create innovative and effective solutions. Most scientific methodologies of working take all the known factors into account when deriving a solution, whereas, design thinking analyses both the known and the unknown. It challenges us to delve deeper into the problem and read between the lines before forming a solution. This talk aims to provide insight into activities and practices that assist developers in building effective, robust, and usable software by utilising the design thinking methodology.</p>

                <h3>Lance Gleason</h3>
              </div>
              <p>Lance has been a computer nut ever since his dad bought him a VIC 20 in the 1980s. After nearly a decade as a Java developer for companies like Kodak, CNN, and GE, he decided to end his addiction to heavy inheritance, static typing, and coding without tests. These days, he practices clean Ruby living with lots of well-tested code, class composition, and fun dynamic languages as a developer/startup CTO for hire with extensive experience in data science and committer on open source projects such as the Passbook-iOS, Asari and Active Asari Gems. He is known to practice interspecies pair (purr) programming with his orange tabby, Allie, and when he's not writing code, you will find him diving with sharks, trekking through Chernobyl, sampling wine, cheering on the Springboks or perfecting his biltong recipe.</p>

              <h2>An Introduction to Functional Programming for Ruby Developers</h2>
              <p>Have you been working on Rails projects but feel your Ruby skills are holding you back? Can you code things in Ruby but know you need to grow in your ability to write tests for your code? Are you a beginner that has followed the first half of a Ruby book from home but have no clue how to make the jump to making something useful?</p>
              <p>Come build a command line flashcard quiz with us. At the end, your program can ask you to answer questions in the terminal. Building something that you can actually use (to learn a bunch of coding terms or to help a relative pass matric) is a lot more motivating than only doing code exercises to get better.</p>

      <h2>Presidents Hotel, Cape Town.</h2>
      <p>Situated in the exclusive and wind-free suburb of Bantry Bay, the President Hotel is a peaceful haven just a step away from the buzz of Cape Town’s CBD. With sweeping views stretching over the endless horizon of the deep blue Atlantic Ocean and nestled below the majestic Lion’s Head, Bantry Bay enjoys an average of 290 wind-free days a year. The average daily sunshine is between 7.5 and 9.5 hours, making the President Hotel’s infinity pool an attractive prospect all year round.</p>
